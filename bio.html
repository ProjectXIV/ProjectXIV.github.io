I love technology. It's been my pleasure and honor to help co-found and grow a number of companies that created impactful advancements, primarily in Information Security. The ripples made by these products and services continue to make work and life easier for countless people across many industries. It feels good to effect positive change in the world by whatever means possible. I have no plans to stop any time soon.

In the past, I've thrown my weight behind visionaries to bring worthwhile improvements to industries both as disruptions and breaths of fresh air. Presently, I'm rounding out my own experience and stepping into the leadership light of my own projects. Details will be announced as progress is made.
